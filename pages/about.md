Hi,

I am **Asit**. And this is my attempt to create a central reporsitory of all my expereinces, stories and learnings. 

The Github pages is as functional as symbolic of the builder in me. An engineer by education and profession, I have built my career in technology, analytics and automation. Working with Fortune 500 companies, I have spent my initial career building core competencies in web development, software engineering and computer programing. In 2nd chapter of my life in Canada, I focused on business skills. Completing my MBA at Schulich School of Business, I am currently working with entrepreneurs and founder helping build new companies and organizations.
